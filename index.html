          On this website, I will take you through my 3-week journey so far in trying to get into running.
          For the past two and a half years, I've been doing weight lifting, but I haven't focused on cardio.
          I always saw cardio as boring, a waste of time, and something that would ruin my muscle gains.
          My friend and I have often dismissed the idea of doing cardio, probably because it was hard for us.
          When I first started going to the gym, I tried running, but I wasn't doing it right.
          I was running at a pace that was too fast for me, and I was exhausted the entire time.
          No wonder I didn't enjoy running. That changed last month when I learned about zone 2 running.

          Motivation

        <p>
          At around the beginning of August this year, my friend and I decided to do a little cardio
          after our workout because we wanted something different. It was a simple incline walk,
          but it made me so exhausted that I was surprised. That was when I decided I was tired of having horrible stamina.
          I started looking into running on social media and learned about concepts such as zone 2, cadence, pace, and more.
          I saw how good runners run and how satisfying it looked. I gave zone 2 running a shot for the first time the next day,
          and I actually kind of enjoyed it. That was when I decided I wanted to get good at running.
